# Getting Started

## Geometry Basics

In this tutorial, we'll begin by defining the geometry for a simple wing.  Note that all the functions used are described in the Reference section of this documentation if you would like further information at any point.  Before you begin this tutorial, it is expected that you've already installed the necessary components of FLOWUnsteady, and that you are familiar with visualization in Paraview.

First things first, we need to include the FLOWUnsteady components
```@setup tut
import FLOWUnsteady
uns = FLOWUnsteady
vlm = uns.vlm

span = 1.0              #wing span
aspectratio = 10.0      #wing aspect ratio
taperratio = 0.5        #wing taper ratio
wingtwist = 0.0         #wing twist
wingsweep = 10.0        #wing sweep in degrees
wingdihedral = 7.0      #wing dihedral in degrees
```

```julia
import FLOWUnsteady
uns = FLOWUnsteady
vlm = uns.vlm
```

Let's begin with a single section, symmetric wing.  We'll start by defining some basic geometry.

```julia
span = 1.0              #wing span
aspectratio = 10.0      #wing aspect ratio
taperratio = 0.5        #wing taper ratio
wingtwist = 0.0         #wing twist
wingsweep = 10.0        #wing sweep in degrees
wingdihedral = 7.0      #wing dihedral in degrees
```

Then we'll call the ```simpleWing()``` function to create a simple wing object.

```@example tut
mainwing = vlm.simpleWing(span,aspectratio,taperratio,wingtwist,wingsweep,wingdihedral)
```

Congratulations! You've created your first wing object.

!!! info "Exploring wing objects"

    If you want, you can take a moment to explore the contents of your newly created ```mainwing```.  You can do so using ```fieldnames(mainwing)``` and poking around. The Reference section will have more info on the contents of the wing object.

Next, let's create a wing system.

```@example tut
system = vlm.WingSystem()
```

You now have an empty wing system, so let's add our mainwing object to it with the name "mainwing."

```@example tut
vlm.addwing(system,"mainwing",mainwing)
```

Now that we have a wing system, let's save it as a .vtk file so we can view it in paraview.  In order to do so, we are required to define a freestream velocity.

```@example tut
Vinf(x,t) = [1,0,0]         #non-dimensional function defining free stream velocity
vlm.setVinf(system, Vinf)   #set freestream velocity for the system
```

We will also want to set some parameters for saving files and set up our file system to put the files where we want.

!!! danger "Be careful with rm"

    Make sure you have set your save_path to something non-important so the ```rm``` command doesn't delete anything you'll miss.

```@example tut
run_name = "tutorial"           #define identifier at beginning of file names
save_path = "./simplewing/"     #define directory where files will be saved

run(`rm -rf $save_path`)        #clear out directory where files will be saved
run(`mkdir $save_path`)         #re-create directory fresh
```

Finally, we can save the files.

```julia
vlm.save(system, run_name; path=save_path)  #save geometry in a .vtk file format
```

And now we can view our wing in Paraview using the command ```run(`paraview --data="$(save_path)/$(run_name)_mainwing_vlm.vtk"`)``` (assuming you've set up an alias for paraview on your computer).

## Adding a Rotor

Now that we have a basic wing, let's go ahead and add a rotor.  We'll use some data for the rotor that already exists in FLOWUnsteady.  You can visit the How-to guides for more information on creating your own rotor database.

```julia
rotor_file = "apc10x7.csv"          # Rotor geometry
data_path = uns.def_data_path       # Path to rotor database
```

With the rotor data, we can generate our rotor. This might take a minute or so to run. We supress the output here with a semi-colon as it prints a large output.

```@example tut
rotor_file = "apc10x7.csv"          # hide
data_path = uns.def_data_path       # hide

R, B = uns.read_rotor(rotor_file; data_path=data_path)[[1,3]] #get the radius for later

rotor = uns.generate_rotor(rotor_file; pitch=0.0,
                                            n=10, CW=true, ReD=1.5e6,
                                            verbose=true, xfoil=true,
                                            data_path=data_path,
                                            plot_disc=false);
```

And then we can generate a rotor object, where we again supress the output.

```@example tut
rotors = vlm.Rotor[rotor];
```

This will put the rotor at the default location and orientation which we will define here since we now need to move the rotor relative to the wing which is already at this location.

```@example tut
vehicleorigin = [0.0; 0.0; 0.0]
vehicleaxis = [1.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 1.0]
```

To move the rotor, we need to define a new origin point.

```@example tut
rotororigin = [-0.1; 0.0; 0.0]
```

Then we can use that origin to set the rotor coordinate system in order to move the rotor.

```@example tut
for rotor in rotors
    vlm.setcoordsystem(rotor, rotororigin, vehicleaxis; user=true)
end
```

which we can put in a tuple that stores our rotor system(s).

```@example tut
rotor_systems = (rotors,);
```

We also need to add it to our overall system.

```@example tut
for rotor in rotors; vlm.addwing(system, run_name, rotor); end;
```

Like setting the Vinf parameter for the main wing, we need to give our rotor an RPM as well.

```@example tut
RPMref = 6000       #reference RPM
for rotor in rotors; vlm.setRPM(rotor, RPMref); end;
```

We should now be able to visualize our wing with a rotor.

```julia
run(`rm -rf $save_path`)
run(`mkdir $save_path`)

vlm.save(system, run_name; path=save_path)
run(`paraview --data="$(save_path)/tutorial_mainwing_vlm.vtk;tutorial_tutorial_Blade1_vlm.vtk;tutorial_tutorial_Blade2_vlm.vtk;tutorial_tutorial_Blade1_loft.vtk;tutorial_tutorial_Blade2_loft.vtk;"`)
```

## Other Systems

In order run an analysis with our little airplane, we're going to have to add a few more systems

### VLM Systems
First let's create a VLM system and add our main wing to it.

```@example tut
vlm_system = vlm.WingSystem()

vlm.addwing(vlm_system, "mainwing", mainwing)
```

### Wake Systems
Next, let's create a wake system and add both the VLM system and rotor.

```@example tut
wake_system = vlm.WingSystem()

vlm.addwing(wake_system, "SolveVLM", vlm_system)

for rotor in rotors; vlm.addwing(wake_system, run_name, rotor); end;
```

### Tilting Systems
We'll also need to identify tilting objects, but since we don't have any tilting components yet, we'll just initialize an empty tuple. For more information on adding tilting objects (like control surfaces, or tilt-wings) see [How to Define Vehicle Systems](@ref).

```@example tut
tilting_systems = ();
```

## Kinematic Maneuvers
Now let's define our maneuver. For now, let's just have the airplane fly in a straight and level. We are going to have to define non-dimensional functions for the velocity for the vehicle, the angle for the vehicle, the angles for our tilting systems, and the rotation rate for the rotor(s).

!!! info "Non-dimensionalized Functions"

    The functions that define the kinematic maneuver must be defined non-dimensionally. For more information on this, see [How to Define Kinematic Maneuvers](@ref).

We'll start with the vehicle velocity function.

```@example tut
Vvehicle(t) = [-1.0,0.0,0.0]
```

Next, let's define the vehicle angle.

```@example tut
anglevehicle(t) = zeros(3)
```

Now the angle of the titling systems (we don't have any, so it's just empty again).

```@example tut
angle = ();
```

Lastly, we need to define a rotation rate function for each of the rotors.

```@example
RPM_fun(t) = 1.0

RPM = (RPM_fun, );
```

With all the individual elements defined, we can create a maneuver

```@example tut
maneuver = uns.KinematicManeuver(angle, RPM, Vvehicle, anglevehicle)
```

We can also plot the maneuver to quickly see what we made.

```@example tut
uns.plot_maneuver(maneuver)
```

A plot of the maneuver is helpful, but visualizing in Paraview can also be helpful. In order to do that, however, we first need to set up a simulation.

## Setting up a Basic Simulation

We already have most of the elements we need to define a simulation, but need to create a vehicle to be used in the simulation with the systems we've already defined.

```@example tut
vehicle = uns.VLMVehicle(   system;
                            tilting_systems = tilting_systems,
                            rotor_systems   = rotor_systems,
                            vlm_system      = vlm_system,
                            wake_system     = wake_system,
                        );
```

In addition, we still need to define a reference velocity, the total time for the simulation, and a few initial conditions.

```@example tut
Vref = 10.0         #define a reference velocity for the vehicle
ttot = 1.0          #define a total simulation time, in seconds
nsteps = 300        #define the number of steps the simulation will take

#initial conditions
tinit = 0.0                                  #initial time
Vinit = Vref*maneuver.Vvehicle(tinit/ttot)   #initial linear velocity
Winit = zeros(3)                             #initial angular velocity
```

With everything now defined, we can create a simulation

```julia
simulation = uns.Simulation(vehicle, maneuver, Vref, RPMref, ttot; Vinit=Vinit, Winit=Winit, t=tinit);
```

Finally, we can visualize the maneuver in Paraview.

```julia
files = uns.visualize_kinematics(   simulation, nsteps, save_path;
                                    run_name=run_name,
                                    prompt=false,
                                    paraview=false
                                )

run(`paraview --data="$save_path/$files"`)
```

 ## Running the Simulation

We also now run the simulation and use Paraview to look at the outputs.

!!! note "Outputs"

    We are only outputting the basic pressure field here. In order to have additional outputs, it is necessary to write some extra runtime functions, see [How to Set up Run-time Functions](@ref) for more information.

!!! note "Run Time"

    Running simulations typcially takes a while.  You may want to reduce ```nsteps```, but the visual below shows results for 300 steps.

```julia
nullfunc(args...) = false
pfield = uns.run_simulation(simulation, nsteps;
                                    surf_sigma=R/10,
                                    Vinf=Vinf,
                                    save_path=save_path,
                                    run_name=run_name,
                                    prompt=false,
                                    verbose=true,
                                    extra_runtime_function=nullfunc
                                    )

run(`paraview --data="$save_path/$(files);tutorial_pfield...vtk"`)
```
