# How to Define Vehicle Systems

In this guide, we will cover how to define complex systems. Basic system definitions were presented in the [First Steps](@ref) tutorial, but applications quickly become more complex than a simple, control-free wing.

## Wing Subsystems

We will first cover creating wing subsystems.  The key here is that any system can be a sub-system. Take, for example, the vertical stabilizer and rudder from [How to define Complex Wings](@ref) which we can define a add to a wing system.

```julia
#Vertical Stabilizer
span = 0.25                                     #length of full span
numlattice = 5                                  #number of lattice elements on half-span
poschord = [0.0; 1.0]                #postion of chord stations
lengthtipchordvstab = 0.05                          #length of tip chord
lengthchordvstab = [1.25; 1.0]     #length of chords
twistchord = [0.0; 0.0]                         #twist of chords, in degrees
sweepsection = [0.0]                      #sweep of sections between chords, in degrees
dihedralsection = [0.0]                    #dihedral of sections between chords, in degrees
aspectratio = span/lengthtipchordvstab

verticalstabilizer = vlm.complexWing(span, aspectratio, numlattice, poschord, lengthchordvstab, twistchord, sweepsection, dihedralsection; symmetric=false, chordalign=1.0)

originvstab = [0.5; 0.0; 0.0]                       #origin moved 0.5 in positive x-direction
csysvstab = [1.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 1.0; 0.0 1.0 0.0] #csys rotated 90 degrees from default
vlm.setcoordsystem(verticalstabilizer,originvstab,csysvstab)


#Rudder
span = 0.25                                     #length of full span
numlattice = 5                                  #number of lattice elements on half-span
poschord = [0.0; 0.25; 1.0]                #postion of chord stations
lengthtipchord = 0.03                          #length of tip chord
lengthchord = [1.25; 1.5; 1.0]     #length of chords
twistchord = [0.0; 0.0; 0.0]                         #twist of chords, in degrees
sweepsection = [0.0; 0.0]                      #sweep of sections between chords, in degrees
dihedralsection = [0.0; 0.0]                    #dihedral of sections between chords, in degrees
aspectratio = span/lengthtipchord

rudder = vlm.complexWing(span, aspectratio, numlattice, poschord, lengthchord, twistchord, sweepsection, dihedralsection; symmetric=false, chordalign=0.0)

lengthrootchordvstab = lengthchordvstab[1]*lengthtipchordvstab
originrudder = [0.5+lengthrootchordvstab; 0.0; 0.0]                       #account for vstab position and chord
csysrudder = [1.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 1.0; 0.0 1.0 0.0] #csys rotated 90 degrees from default
vlm.setcoordsystem(rudder,originrudder,csysrudder)


#System Definition
tail = vlm.WingSystem()
vlm.addwing(tail,"vstab",verticalstabilizer)
vlm.addwing(tail,"rudder",rudder)
```

Now we might want that tail system to be part of a full system, so let's define the main wing and add both it and the tail system to the full system.

```julia
#Main Wing
span = 1.0                      #length of full span
numlattice = 10                 #number of lattice elements on half-span

poschord = [0.0; 0.5; 1.0]./span                #postion of chord stations
lengthtipchord = 0.03                            #length of tip chord
lengthchord = [0.075; 0.05; 0.03]./lengthtipchord   #length of chords
twistchord = [0.0; 0.0; -3.0]                   #twist of chords, in degrees
sweepsection = [10.0; 5.0]      #sweep of sections between chords, in degrees
dihedralsection = [0.0; 7.0]    #dihedral of sections between chords, in degrees
aspectratio = span/lengthtipchord

mainwing = vlm.complexWing(span, aspectratio, numlattice, poschord, lengthchord, twistchord, sweepsection, dihedralsection; symmetric=true)


#System Definition
system = vlm.WingSystem()
vlm.addwing(system,"mainwing",mainwing)
vlm.addwing(system,"tail",tail)
```

And that's all there is to it. The main wing and tail system are now both components of the overall system. Any combination of wing objects and wing systems can be added to any system.

## VLM Systems

Anything that will be solved using the VLM (see Reference) needs to be identified as such. In our case, all the wings fall under this category.

```julia
vlm_system = vlm.WingSystem()
vlm.addwing(vlm_system,"mainwing",mainwing)
vlm.addwing(vlm_system,"tail",tail)
```

## Wake Systems

You need to tell the solver which of the systems you've created need to be included in the wake simulation.  In this case, we want everything to be in our wake system, which is defined just like before.

```julia
wake_system = vlm.WingSystem()
vlm.addwing(wake_system,"mainwing",mainwing)
vlm.addwing(wake_system,"tail",tail)
```


## Rotor Systems

Rotor systems begin with rotors, the definition of which is covered in [How to Define a Custom Rotor](@ref).  Once you have rotors defined with their respetive databases, you can create rotor systems.  Let's add two rotors to our airplane in this guide to see how it is done.

First let's decide where we want to place the rotors.

```julia
posrotorplus = [0.0; 0.25; 0.0]      #xyz position of rotor in positive y-direction
posrotorminus = -posrotorplus       #xyz position of rotor in negative y-direction
vehicleaxis = [1.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 1.0]   #default coordinate system
```

We need a few more parameters for defining rotors as well.

```julia
rotor_file = "apc10x7.csv"          # data file for rotor
data_path = uns.def_data_path       # data path to find file

R, B = uns.read_rotor(rotor_file; data_path=data_path)[[1,3]] #grab rotor radius
n = 100.0                           #target RPS
Vref = 20.0                         #freestream velocity
vind = sqrt( Vref^2 + (n*R)^2 )     #velocity at blade tip
rho = 1.225                         #(kg/m^3) air density
mu = 1.81e-5                        #(kg/ms) air dynamic viscosity
ReD = rho*2.0*R*vind/mu             #Diameter-based Reynolds

numbladeelements = 10               #number of blade elements
rotorpitch = 0.0                    #rotor pitch
```

Now we are ready to define some propellers.

```julia
rotors = vlm.Rotor[]

push!(rotors,
        uns.generate_rotor(rotor_file;
                            pitch=rotorpitch,
                            n=numbladeelements,
                            CW=true,
                            ReD=ReD,
                            verbose=true,
                            xfoil=false,
                            data_path=data_path)
    )


push!(rotors,
        vlm.Rotor(!rotors[1].CW,
                    rotors[1].r,
                    rotors[1].chord,
                    rotors[1].theta,
                    rotors[1].LE_x,
                    rotors[1].LE_z,
                    rotors[1].B,
                    rotors[1].airfoils))

vlm.initialize(rotors[2], rotors[1].m)

vlm.setcoordsystem(rotors[1], posrotorminus, vehicleaxis; user=true)
vlm.setcoordsystem(rotors[2], posrotorplus, vehicleaxis; user=true)
```

Now that we have defined our rotors, we can add them to the other systems

```julia
for (i, rotor) in enumerate(rotors)
    vlm.addwing(system, "rotor$i", rotor)
    vlm.addwing(wake_system, "Rotor$i", rotor)
end
```

!!! note "Repeated Object Names"

    You can only use a specific name in one system. Note how in the example above, ```rotor$i``` is used for the main system, and captial ```Rotor$i``` is used for the wake system


Finally, we need to create our rotor system, which is actually just a tuple of the rotor object we've already created.

```julia
rotor_systems = (rotors, )
```

## Tilting Systems

A tilting system is simply a tuple of all the wing systems that will be rotating according to specific definitions beyond the overall aircraft orientations. In our case, that would just be the rudder.

```julia
tilting_systems = (rudder, )
```
